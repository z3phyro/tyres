You can use it with a UI:

Or with a CLI:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@z3phyro/tyres-cli

# Why use TyRes

Not all javascript/typescript projects use some sort of CMS. I've worked before for companies that literally use a spreadsheet for making their translations in some projects.

In general the process of preparing translations is not so difficult if you have a small project but as the project grows it can get kind of tedious.

Having mutiple languages to translate to makes the process a bit more difficult.

Both the CLI and the UI provide some useful features for both the developer and the translator.
